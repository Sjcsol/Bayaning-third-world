            Bayaning Third World is a 2000 Filipino film directed by Mike de Leon that explores the complexities of Jose Rizal's life, identity, and legacy. Rather than presenting a traditional biographical narrative, the film takes a meta-cinematic approach, blending documentary-style storytelling with fictionalized elements.

The film follows two filmmakers attempting to create a movie about Jose Rizal. As they investigate Rizal's life, they uncover conflicting accounts and unanswered questions surrounding his true intentions, beliefs, and relationships. Central to the narrative is Rizal's controversial retraction document, in which he allegedly renounced his writings and re-embraced the Catholic faith before his execution. The filmmakers engage in debates, interviews, and dramatizations to examine Rizal's motivations, shedding light on his complex role as both a national hero and a controversial figure.

Through this unconventional storytelling style, Bayaning Third World challenges traditional narratives about Rizal, questioning whether he was truly the idealized hero often portrayed in Philippine history. The film invites viewers to reflect on Rizal's identity, the nature of heroism, and the role of history in shaping national consciousness.

1. The filmmakers discuss their intent to create a film about José Rizal. What challenges do they
anticipate in portraying his life? 
<br>
<br>
In that part, they say that if questioning Rizal's heroism is a sin, then they might also be guilty of it, as many mysteries, such as his retraction, if it’s true or not. They seek to explore different perspectives on Rizal to uncover the reality behind his legacy. (1:02-1:10)
<br>
<br>

arguments presented regarding its validity? 
<br>
<br>
The 2 reporter, argue here whether if the retraction here is fake or true, they say the signature is the most controversial thing, that the text is genuine because he want to marry josephine bracken but the signature is questionable because, rizal signature can be forge easily, and the document is left at the hands of friars. (44:26-47:44)
<br>
<br>
3. The character of Josephine Bracken is introduced. How does the film depict her relationship with Rizal? 
<br>
<br>
It shows how Rizal and Josephine Bracken deeply loved each other and lived together in Dapitan as a lovely couple. However, despite their relationship, Rizal’s family did not recognize Josephine as his wife or acknowledge their marriage. (36:42-44:17)
<br>
<br>
4. The filmmakers interview a historian about Rizal’s alleged retraction. What evidence is provided to support or refute the claim? 
<br>
<br>
From (1:05:36 to 1:15:15) Padre Balaguer claims that Rizal retracted hours before his execution. He states that Rizal even confessed, received communion, and attended Mass. However, Rizal’s family did not believe in the retraction because they were not allowed to read and analyze the document to verify its authenticity. (56:10-57:00)
<br>
<br>
5. The film presents different portrayals of Rizal’s execution. How does each version differ, and what do these differences suggest?
<br>
<br>
The first portrayals show how Rizal executed, straight to the point.  while the 2nd shows what Rizal did, before he was executed: he received communion, confessed, and kissed the cross meaning he retracted, then executed. (1:04:34- 1:05:34)
 <br>
 <br>
6. One of the characters questions whether Rizal was truly a hero. What reasoning do they give to challenge his heroism? 
<br>
<br>
The characters challenge his heroism because Rizal abandoned the revolution. He say that Rizal was afraid of the Spanish and that he disregarded his writings because he wanted to marry Josephine Bracken. (1:02:30-1:04:30)
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
8. The film uses a unique narrative style, including fictionalized conversations with Rizal. How does this technique affect storytelling? 
<br>
<br>
The fictionalized conversation of Rizal made the storytelling more interesting, because actors can show their emotions and questions that they want to ask Rizal if he’s alive,to clear up things. Rizal represents the things they know about Rizal, so he’ll just say what the film knows. (1:22:38 - 1:28:30)
<br>
<br>
9. At one point, the filmmakers express frustration with their research on Rizal. What specific issue causes this frustration? 
<br>
<br>
Here the 2 actors show their frustration about rizal research, they’re arguing because it’s  easy to debunk their opinion and research because of lack of documents and its validity, two of them only rely on what’s available information. (44:20-47:37)
<br>
<br>
10. The film concludes with a reflection on Rizal’s legacy. How do the filmmakers interpret his impact on contemporary Philippine society?
<br>
<br>
The film shows that the legacy of Rizal will not be forgotten, whether the retraction is true or not, nothing will change that he's the first Filipino and the great malayan. His face is in the 1 peso coin, and he’ll always be the national hero of the Philippines whether he likes it or not. (1:27:25-1:29:27)

            <h3> Agrarian Reform During Colonial Period</h3>
            <p>
                Agrarian Reform During the Spanish Colonial Period

During the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, the agrarian system was heavily skewed in favor of Spanish landlords, the clergy, and powerful local elites. The Spanish government implemented a land tenure system called the encomienda, which initially aimed to manage land distribution and promote settlement. However, this system ultimately led to widespread land grabbing and exploitation.

The haciendas, large agricultural estates owned primarily by Spanish friars and wealthy landowners, further worsened the plight of Filipino farmers. Indigenous tenants, known as kasama or inquilinos, worked these lands under oppressive conditions, facing high rents, forced labor, and unjust taxation. This system resulted in deep socio-economic inequality, fostering resentment among the native population. <br>

<h3>Impact on Jose Rizal's Life</h3>
<p>
The injustices brought by the colonial agrarian system significantly impacted Jose Rizal's life and activism. Rizal's family was directly affected by the land conflict with the Dominican friars, who claimed ownership of their estate in Calamba, Laguna. This dispute escalated into a legal battle that eventually led to the eviction of Rizal's family and other tenants from their lands. This personal experience deeply influenced Rizal's writings, notably his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo*.

In Noli Me Tangere, Rizal highlighted the exploitation of Filipino farmers by corrupt friars and government officials, exposing the abuses in the agrarian system. His portrayal of characters like Elias and Ibarra reflected the struggles of those who suffered under this unjust system. The oppressive land policies also fueled Rizal's call for social reforms, ultimately contributing to his role as a national hero who championed Filipino rights and independence.

Rizal's firsthand experience with agrarian injustices not only shaped his political awakening but also strengthened his resolve to fight for equality, justice, and national sovereignty. </p>
